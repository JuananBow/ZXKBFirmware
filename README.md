#ZX Spectrum+ Keyboard Project

Being a ZX Spectrum fan with a small collection including my original ZX Spectrum 48k from Christmas 1983, I decided to take an empty Spectrum+ case and turn it into a keyboard that could be used with a Rasberry Pi running the Fuse-sdl emulator.

There is some great information on Google about others that have tacked the problem, so having checked out what others have done including a great right up by [PJ Evans](http://mrpjevans.com/2015/12/building-the-zx-raspberry-part-one/) I __borrowed__ my sons Arduino kit and started experimenting.

This github project is the Arduino code I'm using to drive the keyboard through a Pro Micro from e-bay and I've also attached a [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) diagram of the wiring :O)

Thanks go to all those who have gone before me and shared their information. It made the whole exercise much easier.
